# Assignment Readme:

## My approach to designing, implementing and testing

### Design

My approach to designing the app was to keep it simple. I went through every page on the https://www.successacademies.org/ site, and looked for style patterns I could reuse. For example, I took the orange color (made a SCSS variable of it), the Akkurat font, and reviewed the most common break points.

### Implementation

Once again I tried to keep it simple.

I added bootstrap to take care of the responsiveness of the page, so I could focus on picking the right styles and layout for the content.

Also, I kept the api call in the main app as I felt taking it outside of it would have been too much for this project.

### Testing

I did responsive browser testing on the two browsers installed on my computer (Chrome and Safari). I also tested multiple phones in the Chrome dev tools simulator.
